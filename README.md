# Techstop Ecommerce Website

## Description
  
As a people who are very involved in the techworld, we are often faced with the want or need to acquire new tools and gadgets that we will use daily for work or for fun. Providing a website that fulfills this need for others was our goal when we set out to create an ecommerce website centered around tech. We learned how to polish a fullstack application that follows the mvc paradigm, we learned how to use a CSS framework called tailwindscss, and we learned what it takes to operate efficently as a team of web developers.
