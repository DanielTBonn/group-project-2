# PROCESS

## TECHNOLOGIES USED

Besides the required technologies such as mysql, handlebars, and express, we decided to implement tailwindscss, a 
CSS framework that would streamline the process of changing the html on the page. Most of what you see was designed
either using a tailwind prebuilt component or built by hand through the tailwinds documentation. 

## BREAKDOWN OF TASKS AND ROLES

We tried to divide up our tasks to cover groud most efficently, 
Eric was given the job of working on the frontend,
Christian and Abdul both acquired data, made some changes to the models, and helped with general tasks,
Daniel filled out the backend structure and figured out how to implement tailwinds.

## Challenges

The fast paced nature of this course meant that we struggled to grasp all the variables placed in front of us, so we took some extra time 
to understand the extent of what we could accomplish as a team. The last stretch of the project proved the most difficult since we took our time
figuring out what extra technology we had to use. Handlebars has also been a source of constant headaches due to its limited logic so we had to find
some work arounds that suited our needs. Another challenge was that the user story was a bit complicated at first and took some time for us to actually write,
so we had to play it by ear for a lot of things.

## Successes

When we got started on the project we were able to achieve the most of the mvp rather quickly. Once we played around with tailwinds for a little bit
it also started to become easy to use since it was just a refresher on bootstrap like principles. Towards the end of the project once we were a little better
accquainted we were able to come togther and work as a proper team as well and get things done efficiently.
